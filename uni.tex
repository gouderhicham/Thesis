\subsection*{\textbf{1.1 Study of Existing Solutions: Geolocation, Search on Google Maps}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1.1 Study of Existing Solutions: Geolocation, Search on Google Maps}

Several solutions exist for finding hospitals and clinics, but they have \textbf{significant limitations}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Google Maps:}
	      Google Maps is the most widely used mapping service, offering general hospital searches. However, it \textbf{lacks precise information on clinics}, including doctors' availability, specialties, and operating hours.
	\item \textbf{Hospital Finder by Darshan University:}
	      This global application \textbf{only fetches hospital data from the Google Maps API} without allowing clinics to \textbf{add or modify their information}. Additionally, its \textbf{user interface is outdated}, making navigation difficult.
	\item \textbf{Local Availability:}
	      Currently, \textbf{no local application} provides a \textbf{dedicated hospital and clinic management system} that allows clinics to \textbf{register themselves, update details, and display real-time doctor availability}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\textbf{1.2 Critique of Existing Solutions and Proposed Solution}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1.2 Critique of Existing Solutions and Proposed Solution}
\textbf{Limitations of Existing Solutions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item No \textbf{custom clinic registration} or modifications
	\item Outdated UI and poor \textbf{user experience}
	\item No \textbf{detailed doctor profiles and schedules}
	\item Google Maps data is \textbf{too general} and lacks \textbf{localized clinic information}
	\item \textbf{Navigation issues} due to the absence of clear or guided paths to clinic locations, especially in certain areas
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Proposed Solution:}
To overcome these limitations, our \textbf{Hospital Finder Mobile Application} introduces:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Enhanced Geolocation} → Provides \textbf{precise clinic locations} added by clinic administrators themselves.
	\item \textbf{Clinic Registration \& Management} → Clinics can \textbf{create, modify, and update their information}.
	\item \textbf{Detailed Doctor Profiles} → Displays \textbf{doctor specialties, working hours, availability, and schedules}.
	\item \textbf{Nearby Hospital \& Clinic Recommendations} → Suggests hospitals and clinics \textbf{based on real-time location}.
	\item \textbf{Integrated GPS \& Path Navigation} → Provides \textbf{step-by-step directions and map-based paths to each clinic}, addressing the issue of poor accessibility in some areas.
	\item \textbf{Modern UI \& Better User Experience} → A \textbf{new, intuitive, and visually appealing interface}.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\textbf{2 Conclusion}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{2 Conclusion}

The existing hospital location solutions fail to provide \textbf{detailed, precise, and user-friendly} hospital and clinic information. Our \textbf{Hospital Finder Mobile Application} bridges this gap by offering:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{better geolocation system} for \textbf{more accurate clinic placement}.
	\item The ability for \textbf{clinics to register and update their details}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{3 Functional Requirements Specification}

\noindent The functional requirements define the expected behavior of the application. These include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User Authentication:} Clinics, doctors, and admins must log in securely.
	\item \textbf{Geolocation Services:} Users can find nearby clinics and doctors with precise locations.
	\item \textbf{Clinic and Doctor Management:} Clinics can add doctors, and update their availability.
	\item \textbf{Admin Panel:} The admin can approve or reject clinic registrations and user reports and also can delete or suspent Clinic account.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\textbf{4 Non-Functional Requirements Specification}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{4 Non-Functional Requirements Specification}
\noindent The non-functional requirements define the application's quality attributes, such as performance, security, and usability.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Performance:} The application should provide quick search results with minimal load time.
	\item \textbf{Security:} User data must be encrypted, and authentication should be secure.
	\item \textbf{Scalability:} The system should handle a growing number of users and clinics efficiently.
	\item \textbf{User-Friendly Interface:} The UI should be intuitive and responsive across all devices.

\subsection*{\textbf{5.1 Definition of Use Case Diagrams}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{5.1 Definition of Use Case Diagrams}


\noindent A \textbf{Use Case Diagram} is a visual representation that describes the interactions between users (actors) and the system. It outlines the different functionalities provided by the application and the roles of each user in relation to those functionalities.

\noindent These diagrams are part of \textbf{Unified Modeling Language (UML)} and help in understanding how users engage with the application. The primary components of a use case diagram include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Actors:} Represent users or external systems interacting with the application.
	\item \textbf{Use Cases:} Define specific actions that users can perform in the system.
	\item \textbf{Associations:} Indicate the relationship between actors and their use cases.
	\item \textbf{System Boundary:} Defines the scope of the application by enclosing all the use cases.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The goal of these diagrams is to **provide a clear, high-level understanding** of how different actors interact with the system’s functionalities, making it easier for developers, stakeholders, and designers to visualize and refine the system requirements.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent \textbf{Observation:} In this and other diagrams, the element \textbf{ \texttt{<<abstract>> Do/ask Server}} acts as a unified layer for all communication between the app and backend.\textbf{"Do"} refers to sending commands to perform actions, while \textbf{"Ask"} refers to requesting information. This abstraction centralizes operations like in this diagram example: View Data which is a sending a request to our \textbf{App's Server/Database} and managing into one scalable points, keeping diagrams clean and consistent.

\chapter{\textbf{Application's Conception}}
\rule{\linewidth}{1.5pt}


\section*{\textbf{1 Introduction}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{1 Introduction}

\noindent In this chapter, we present the design phase of our mobile application \textit{Hospital Finder}. Following the analysis and specification of requirements, this stage is essential to define the structural and behavioral aspects of the application.

\noindent The design phase translates the identified functionalities into technical diagrams that guide implementation. These include use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams. Each diagram offers a different perspective, illustrating how components interact and how the system is structured internally.

\subsection*{1.1 Use Case Actors Overview}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1.1 Use Case Actors Overview}

\noindent The application involves multiple actors such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User}: the main end-user searching for hospitals or clinics.
	\item \textbf{Clinic}: responsible for managing their own clinic profile and associated doctors.
	\item \textbf{Admin}: oversees the system and manages reported data or misuse.
	\item \textbf{Doctor}: while present in the system, the doctor does not interact directly with the application and is managed entirely by the clinic.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\noindent We will observe their interactions more thoroughly in the diagrams presented in the following sections.

\noindent \textbf{A summarized view of the main actors is illustrated in the diagram below :}

\end{center}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\section*{2 Detailed Design}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{2 Detailed Design}

This section presents the core structural design of the \textit{Hospital Finder} application. After analyzing the system’s requirements and actors, we now focus on how these elements are implemented internally.

\noindent The detailed design phase provides a clear \textbf{technical blueprint} by describing the key components, their responsibilities, and how they interact. This allows for a smooth transition from the functional analysis to the actual development.

\noindent \textbf{UML} (Unified Modeling Language) offers various diagrams to describe a software system from different perspectives. These diagrams are generally grouped into two main categories:


\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Structural diagrams} - describe the static aspects of the system, such as classes and their relationships.
	\item \textbf{Behavioral diagrams} - illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system, such as interactions and workflows between components.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
	\vspace{1.5cm}

	\includegraphics[width=14cm]{images/diagramType.pdf}

\end{center}
\begin{center}
	\textit{\textbf{Figure: Classification of UML diagrams (structure vs behavior).}}
\end{center}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent In Chapter 2, we presented a \textbf{Use Case Diagram}, which belongs to the behavioral category. In this chapter, we will explore two additional diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{Class Diagram}, selected from the structural diagrams.
	\item The \textbf{Sequence Diagram}, selected from the behavioral diagrams.
\end{itemize}

\noindent These diagrams allow us to model both the architecture and the interactions in our application in a clear and structured manner. We begin with the class diagram in the next section.

\subsection*{2.1 Class Diagram}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2.1 Class Diagram}

A class diagram plays a key role in the object-oriented design of software systems. In this section, we will define what a class diagram is, explain its importance in the development process, and finally present the class diagram of our \textit{Hospital Finder} application.

\subsubsection*{2.1.1 What is a Class Diagram ?}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.1.1 What is a Class Diagram ?}
\vspace{0.1cm}

A \textbf{class diagram} is a static structural diagram that describes the types of objects in the system and the various kinds of \textbf{relationships} that exist among them. It shows the system's \textbf{classes}, their \textbf{attributes}, \textbf{methods}, and the \textbf{associations} between objects. It is one of the most commonly used diagrams in \textbf{UML} (Unified Modeling Language) and serves as a \textbf{blueprint} for the \textbf{implementation phase}.

\noindent Each class is represented as a rectangle divided into compartments. The top compartment shows the \textbf{class name}, the middle one lists the \textbf{attributes}, and the bottom lists the \textbf{operations} or \textbf{methods}.


\subsubsection*{2.1.2 Why Use a Class Diagram ?}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.1.2 Why Use a Class Diagram ?}
\vspace{0.1cm}


The \textbf{class diagram} is essential in the software development lifecycle for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\item It provides a visual overview of the system \textbf{structure}.
	\item It helps developers understand how \textbf{data} is organized and managed.
	\item It facilitates the identification of responsibilities and roles of each class.
	\item It reflects both the logical architecture and the design of the application's \textbf{database}.
	\item It helps in detecting potential \textbf{design flaws} early in the development process.
\end{itemize}

\noindent In the context of our project, the \textbf{class diagram} acts as a bridge between the \textbf{actors} (users, clinics, doctors, and admins) and the data handled internally. It helps clarify how the \textbf{components} of the system interact with one another and ensures a consistent and maintainable code structure.


\subsubsection*{2.1.3 Class Diagram of the Application}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.1.3 Class Diagram of the Application}
\vspace{0.1cm}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.2.1 Definition}
\vspace{0.1cm}

Sequence diagrams are a type of UML behavioral diagram that show how objects or components in a system interact with each other over time. They describe the flow of messages and the order of operations between actors and system parts in specific scenarios.

Each sequence diagram illustrates how different entities collaborate in a particular process, using lifelines, messages, and activation bars to convey their roles and responsibilities.

\subsubsection*{2.2.2 Purpose and Importance}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.2.2 Purpose and Importance}
\vspace{0.1cm}


\textbf{Sequence diagrams} are essential for modeling \textbf{dynamic behavior} in a system. They help developers understand the exact \textbf{flow of operations}, communication between objects, and timing of events.

In our case, these diagrams allow us to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Clearly visualize \textbf{interactions} between the application interface, users (like admin), and the backend (\textbf{database}).
	\item Ensure that the designed processes are logically consistent and complete.
\end{itemize}

\section*{3 Conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{3 Conclusion}

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
The design phase of our \textit{Hospital Finder} mobile application has been carefully structured to ensure clarity, consistency, and extensibility. Throughout this chapter, we laid the foundation of the application by modeling its components and interactions using essential UML diagrams.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent
We began with the class diagram, which defined the main entities such as users, clinics, doctors, and the admin, along with their relationships. This provided a blueprint for structuring the database and guiding the backend development. Each class was tailored to support the application's functionality, ensuring that both user and system needs are represented.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
Subsequently, we introduced a series of sequence diagrams to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system. These diagrams covered key interactions including user registration, clinic requests, login, searching, and admin management operations. Particular focus was placed on administrator features—such as reviewing clinic applications and handling user reports—emphasizing the application's flexibility and administrative control.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
Each interaction was modeled to ensure that data flows seamlessly through the app interface and is consistently stored or retrieved from the database. The logical flow within these diagrams also helps in pinpointing edge cases, user roles, and error-handling scenarios.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
In summary, this conception phase has transformed abstract requirements into detailed structural and behavioral models. These models not only support the system’s current requirements but also anticipate future enhancements. The groundwork laid here will facilitate a smoother transition to the implementation phase, ensuring that development is aligned with the overall system design.

\subsubsection*{2.2.1 Technologies Used}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.2.1 Technologies Used}
It presents the main technologies adopted, such as the programming language, development platform, and the chosen database management .

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Programming Language:} The most vital and indispensable tool in our project is \textbf{Dart}, used through the \textbf{Flutter} framework. Flutter enables us to develop a cross-platform mobile application (Android and iOS) from a single codebase, significantly accelerating development and ensuring a consistent user experience. Below is a flowchart to illustrate how Flutter operates:
	      \vspace{0.5cm}
	      \begin{center}
		      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/FlutterDiagram@2x.pdf}
		      \textit{\textbf{Figure: Flutter Architecture Flowchart}}
	      \end{center}


	\item \textbf{Development Environments:} We primarily used \textbf{Visual Studio Code} and \textbf{Android Studio} as our code editors and development environments, which are widely recognized and powerful for mobile app development.

	\item \textbf{Backend:} We chose the \textbf{Laravel} PHP framework for creating the backend API. It provided us with a clear MVC structure, enhanced security, and easy management of routes and controllers.

	\item \textbf{Database:} The application uses a \textbf{MySQL} database, which we designed and hosted on a \textbf{Hostinger} server. The backend files were also deployed on this server to handle API communication with the mobile app.

	\item \textbf{Firebase:} Integrated for backend services, particularly \textbf{authentication}. We used \textbf{Google Console} to enable patients to log in using their Google accounts.

	\item \textbf{Testing Tools:} We used \textbf{Postman} to test various API requests and endpoints before integrating them into the mobile app.

	\item \textbf{Version Control:} Our source code was managed using \textbf{Git} and hosted on \textbf{GitHub}, which facilitated team collaboration and version tracking.

	\item \textbf{Design Tools:} We used \textbf{Figma} to design the user interface of the app and create user flow diagrams. For database modeling and class diagrams, we used \textbf{dbdiagram.io}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2.3 Database Management System}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2.3 Database Management System}
\rule{0.40\linewidth}{0.5pt} \\[-1.0cm]
\subsubsection*{• 2.3.1 Overview and Tools}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.3.1 Overview and Tools}
In this project, special focus was given to designing and implementing the database using Laravel, which provides an efficient system for migrations, models, and seeders. This section describes the workflow, tools, and structure adopted for managing data throughout the application.

\noindent The database schema was initially designed using \textbf{dbdiagram.io}, a web-based tool for visualizing tables, fields, and relationships. This served as a blueprint, ensuring a well-structured relational database before implementation.

\noindent Throughout development, \textbf{phpMyAdmin} was used to manage and inspect the MySQL database, complementing Laravel’s command-line tools for data verification and query testing.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsubsection*{• 2.3.2 Implementation with Laravel}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.3.2 Implementation with Laravel}

The schema was implemented using Laravel’s \textbf{migration system}, with each table defined in separate migration files, specifying columns, data types, keys, and constraints. Laravel’s migrations provide version control, simplifying maintenance and scaling.

\noindent \textbf{Eloquent models} were created for each table, acting as an abstraction layer to handle operations like insertion, updates, deletion, and retrieval. These models also define interrelations (e.g., \texttt{hasMany}, \texttt{belongsTo}), reflecting the relational schema.

\noindent \textbf{Seeders} were used to populate the database with essential data, useful during development, testing, or first-time deployments.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsubsection*{• 2.3.3 Authentication and Access Control}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.3.3 Authentication and Access Control}

While backend authentication is covered in another section, the system enforces strict \textbf{role-based access control} (RBAC). Each user (doctor, clinic, admin, general user) receives an assigned role, and access permissions are enforced accordingly.

\noindent \textbf{Firebase Authentication} (email/password, Google Sign-In) is integrated via the \textbf{Google Cloud Console}. After client-side login (Flutter), a Firebase token is sent to the backend, where Laravel verifies it using the Firebase Admin SDK and issues a Laravel session token with \textbf{Laravel Sanctum}.

\noindent \textbf{Sanctum} securely manages API tokens and sessions. Custom middleware checks the user’s Firebase UID, fetches their role, and enforces permissions, returning a 403 error for unauthorized actions.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsubsection*{• 2.3.4 Diagrams and Database Schema}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.3.4 Diagrams and Database Schema}

The diagrams below illustrate two key components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{MVC Architecture} of our app with models, controllers, and views. Note that the shown models, views, and controllers are only a few examples of the many present in the application. Each use case’s components are consistently represented in the same color, helping to visually group related parts.
	\item \textbf{Laravel Sanctum flow}, demonstrating how tokens are validated before requests reach the database and Hostinger API. The flow includes step indicators:

	      \par \texttt{1.1} – Generate Token On Login
	      \par \texttt{2.1} – Api Request
	      \par \texttt{2.2} – Check of Token is Valid Using Laravel Sanctum Api
	      \par \texttt{2.3} – Reject if not Valid
	      \par \texttt{3.1} – Allow Data Access ( CRED Operation )
	      \par \texttt{3.2} – Response ( OK / Not OK )
	      \par \texttt{3.3} – Display Response
	      \par \texttt{4.1} – Avoid 3rd parties Api from accessing our App api using sanctum

\subsubsection*{• 2.3.5 Final Setup}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{2.3.5 Final Setup}
To finalize setup, we used the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=darkbash, language=bash, caption={Laravel command to run migrations and seeders}, belowcaptionskip=10pt]
	php artisan migrate --seed
\end{lstlisting}
	

\noindent This command runs all migrations and executes seeders, preparing the database for integration.
