\chapter{\textbf{Theoretical Study and Technical Choices}}
\rule{\linewidth}{1.5pt}


\section{\textbf{Introduction}}

In today's digital age, access to precise and reliable healthcare information is essential. Many existing applications provide hospital location services, but they often lack \textbf{detailed and accurate clinic information}.
This chapter explores the theoretical aspects of our \textbf{Hospital Finder Mobile Application}, analyzes existing solutions, and presents our improved approach.

\section{\textbf{Preliminary Study}}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\rule{7.5cm}{1.5pt}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\subsection{\textbf{Study of Existing Solutions: Geolocation, Search on Google Maps, …}}

Several solutions exist for finding hospitals and clinics, but they have \textbf{significant limitations}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Google Maps:}
	      Google Maps is the most widely used mapping service, offering general hospital searches. However, it \textbf{lacks precise information on clinics}, including doctors' availability, specialties, and operating hours.
	\item \textbf{Hospital Finder by Darshan University:}
	      This global application \textbf{only fetches hospital data from the Google Maps API} without allowing clinics to \textbf{add or modify their information}. Additionally, its \textbf{user interface is outdated}, making navigation difficult.
	\item \textbf{Local Availability:}
	      Currently, \textbf{no local application} provides a \textbf{dedicated hospital and clinic management system} that allows clinics to \textbf{register themselves, update details, and display real-time doctor availability}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Critique of Existing Solutions and Proposed Solution}}

\textbf{Limitations of Existing Solutions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item No \textbf{custom clinic registration} or modifications
	\item Outdated UI and poor \textbf{user experience}
	\item No \textbf{detailed doctor profiles and schedules}
	\item Google Maps data is \textbf{too general} and lacks \textbf{localized clinic information}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Proposed Solution:}
To overcome these limitations, our \textbf{Hospital Finder Mobile Application} introduces:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Enhanced Geolocation} → Provides \textbf{precise clinic locations} added by clinic administrators themselves.
	\item \textbf{Clinic Registration \& Management} → Clinics can \textbf{create, modify, and update their information}.
	\item \textbf{Detailed Doctor Profiles} → Displays \textbf{doctor specialties, working hours, availability, and schedules}.
	\item \textbf{Nearby Hospital \& Clinic Recommendations} → Suggests hospitals and clinics \textbf{based on real-time location}.
	\item \textbf{Modern UI \& Better User Experience} → A \textbf{new, intuitive, and visually appealing interface}.
\end{itemize}

\section{\textbf{Conclusion}}

The existing hospital location solutions fail to provide \textbf{detailed, precise, and user-friendly} hospital and clinic information. Our \textbf{Hospital Finder Mobile Application} bridges this gap by offering:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{better geolocation system} for \textbf{more accurate clinic placement}.
	\item The ability for \textbf{clinics to register and update their details}.
	\item \textbf{Comprehensive doctor profiles}, making hospital visits more efficient.
	\item \textbf{A modern UI} with an intuitive design for easy navigation.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This enhanced system will significantly improve \textbf{healthcare accessibility} and provide a \textbf{better user experience} compared to existing solutions.

\section*{\textbf{1. Introduction}}

\noindent In this chapter, we present the design phase of our mobile application \textit{Hospital Finder}. Following the analysis and specification of requirements, this stage is essential to define the structural and behavioral aspects of the application. 

\noindent The design phase translates the identified functionalities into technical diagrams that guide implementation. These include use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams. Each diagram offers a different perspective, illustrating how components interact and how the system is structured internally.

\subsection*{1.1 Use Case Actors Overview}

\noindent The application involves multiple actors such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User}: the main end-user searching for hospitals or clinics.
    \item \textbf{Clinic}: responsible for managing their own clinic profile and associated doctors.
    \item \textbf{Admin}: oversees the system and manages reported data or misuse.
    \item \textbf{Doctor}: while present in the system, the doctor does not interact directly with the application and is managed entirely by the clinic.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\noindent To better understand the roles and relationships of these actors, we will observe their interactions more thoroughly in the diagrams presented in the following sections. However, \textbf{ a summarized view of the main actors is illustrated in the diagram below: }

\section*{2. Detailed Design}

This section presents the core structural design of the \textit{Hospital Finder} application. After analyzing the system’s requirements and actors, we now focus on how these elements are implemented internally.

\noindent The detailed design phase provides a clear technical blueprint by describing the key components, their responsibilities, and how they interact. This allows for a smooth transition from the functional analysis to the actual development.

\noindent UML (Unified Modeling Language) offers various diagrams to describe a software system from different perspectives. These diagrams are generally grouped into two main categories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structural diagrams} - describe the static aspects of the system, such as classes and their relationships.
    \item \textbf{Behavioral diagrams} - illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system, such as interactions and workflows between components.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/diagramtypes.pdf}
\end{center}

\textit{Figure 3.1: Classification of UML diagrams (structure vs behavior).}

\noindent In Chapter 2, we presented a \textbf{Use Case Diagram}, which belongs to the behavioral category. In this chapter, we will explore two additional diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Class Diagram}, selected from the structural diagrams.
    \item The \textbf{Sequence Diagram}, selected from the behavioral diagrams.
\end{itemize}

These diagrams allow us to model both the architecture and the interactions in our application in a clear and structured manner. We begin with the class diagram in the next section.

\subsection*{2.1 Class Diagram}

A class diagram plays a key role in the object-oriented design of software systems. In this section, we will define what a class diagram is, explain its importance in the development process, and finally present the class diagram of our \textit{Hospital Finder} application.

\subsubsection*{2.1.1 What is a Class Diagram?}

A class diagram is a static structural diagram that describes the types of objects in the system and the various kinds of relationships that exist among them. It shows the system's classes, their attributes, methods, and the associations between objects. It is one of the most commonly used diagrams in UML (Unified Modeling Language) and serves as a blueprint for the implementation phase.

\noindent Each class is represented as a rectangle divided into compartments. The top compartment shows the class name, the middle one lists the attributes, and the bottom lists the operations or methods.

\subsubsection*{2.1.2 Why Use a Class Diagram?}

The class diagram is essential in the software development lifecycle for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It provides a visual overview of the system structure.
    \item It helps developers understand how data is organized and managed.
    \item It facilitates the identification of responsibilities and roles of each class.
    \item It reflects both the logical architecture and the design of the application's database.
    \item It helps in detecting potential design flaws early in the development process.
\end{itemize}

\noindent In the context of our project, the class diagram acts as a bridge between the actors (users, clinics, doctors, and admins) and the data handled internally. It helps clarify how the components of the system interact with one another and ensures a consistent and maintainable code structure.

\subsubsection*{2.1.3 Class Diagram of the Application}

The class diagram of the \textit{Hospital Finder} application was developed based on the functional and non-functional requirements outlined during the analysis phase. It models the following key classes:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{User}: Represents a normal user of the app who can log in, search for hospitals or clinics, and view details.
    \item \textbf{Clinic}: Can register, log in, and manage doctors under its name.
    \item \textbf{Doctor}: Doctors are managed by clinics and linked to their profiles but do not directly interact with the system.
    \item \textbf{Admin}: Has elevated privileges and can monitor the system, manage content, and respond to reports or user issues.
    \item \textbf{Hospital}: A general entity with details such as name, location, specialty, and contact information.
    \item \textbf{TODO }: TODO LATER 
\end{itemize}

The class diagram is shown below:

\end{center}

\subsection*{2.2 Sequence Diagrams}

\subsubsection{2.2.1 Definition}
Sequence diagrams are a type of UML behavioral diagram that show how objects or components in a system interact with each other over time. They describe the flow of messages and the order of operations between actors and system parts in specific scenarios.

Each sequence diagram illustrates how different entities collaborate in a particular process, using lifelines, messages, and activation bars to convey their roles and responsibilities.

\subsubsection*{2.2.2 Purpose and Importance}
Sequence diagrams are essential for modeling dynamic behavior in a system. They help developers understand the exact flow of operations, communication between objects, and timing of events.

In our case, these diagrams allow us to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly visualize interactions between the application interface, users (like admin), and the backend (database).
    \item Ensure that the designed processes are logically consistent and complete.
    \item Serve as references for both implementation and testing phases.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{2.2.3 Application Sequence Diagrams}
Below, we present a set of sequence diagrams that demonstrate different operations carried out by the admin user. Each diagram focuses on a specific use case and models the message flow involved.

\section*{3. Conclusion}

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
The design phase of our \textit{Hospital Finder} mobile application has been carefully structured to ensure clarity, consistency, and extensibility. Throughout this chapter, we laid the foundation of the application by modeling its components and interactions using essential UML diagrams.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
We began with the class diagram, which defined the main entities such as users, clinics, doctors, and the admin, along with their relationships. This provided a blueprint for structuring the database and guiding the backend development. Each class was tailored to support the application's functionality, ensuring that both user and system needs are represented.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
Subsequently, we introduced a series of sequence diagrams to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system. These diagrams covered key interactions including user registration, clinic requests, login, searching, and admin management operations. Particular focus was placed on administrator features—such as reviewing clinic applications, editing terms and conditions, and handling user reports—emphasizing the application's flexibility and administrative control.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
Each interaction was modeled to ensure that data flows seamlessly through the app interface and is consistently stored or retrieved from the database. The logical flow within these diagrams also helps in pinpointing edge cases, user roles, and error-handling scenarios.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
In summary, this conception phase has transformed abstract requirements into detailed structural and behavioral models. These models not only support the system’s current requirements but also anticipate future enhancements. The groundwork laid here will facilitate a smoother transition to the implementation phase, ensuring that development is aligned with the overall system design.
