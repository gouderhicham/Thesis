	\noindent In many regions, private medical clinics and hospitals are widespread, making it difficult for residents and visitors to locate suitable healthcare facilities quickly.  

	\noindent Patients often struggle to find nearby hospitals, determine the best routes, or identify available medical services, especially in emergencies. This challenge is particularly significant for individuals unfamiliar with the area or those seeking specialized medical care.  
	
	\noindent To address this issue, we propose the development of a mobile application that enables users to geolocate hospitals and medical clinics efficiently.
	\vspace*{0.5cm}  
	
	\noindent The application integrates mapping services to provide accurate locations and essential details about healthcare institutions. Additionally, it allows users to contact clinics directly via phone for inquiries and appointments. \vspace*{0.5cm}  
	
	\noindent By offering a user-friendly interface and real-time location-based services, this application aims to enhance accessibility to healthcare facilities, improve navigation for patients, and support better healthcare decision-making.  \vspace*{0.5cm}
