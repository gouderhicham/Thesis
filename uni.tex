\section{Clinic Definition}
A clinic is an entity that registers in the app to add doctors and manage their data. When a clinic registers, it is not accepted automatically; it requires approval from the admin.

\subsection{Main Task of the Clinic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enter clinic information during registration (name, address, phone number, specialties).
    \item Wait for \textbf{admin approval} before becoming active.
    \item Once approved, the clinic can:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Add doctors} to the system.
        \item \textbf{Provide login credentials} (email and password) to doctors.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \item Log in using \textbf{the email and password} provided by the clinic.
    \item Access and manage \textbf{their schedule}.
    \item Receive \textbf{patient bookings} and view appointment details.

    \item Accept or reject clinics based on the provided information.
    \item Ensure the smooth operation of the platform.
