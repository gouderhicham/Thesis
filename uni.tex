\chapter{\textbf{Theoretical Study and Technical Choices}}  
\rule{\linewidth}{1.5pt} 


\section{\textbf{Introduction}}  

In today's digital age, access to precise and reliable healthcare information is essential. Many existing applications provide hospital location services, but they often lack \textbf{detailed and accurate clinic information}.  
This chapter explores the theoretical aspects of our \textbf{Hospital Finder Mobile Application}, analyzes existing solutions, and presents our improved approach.  

\section{\textbf{Preliminary Study}}  
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\rule{7.5cm}{1.5pt}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\subsection{\textbf{Study of Existing Solutions: Geolocation, Search on Google Maps, …}}  

Several solutions exist for finding hospitals and clinics, but they have \textbf{significant limitations}:  

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Google Maps:}  
    Google Maps is the most widely used mapping service, offering general hospital searches. However, it \textbf{lacks precise information on clinics}, including doctors' availability, specialties, and operating hours.  
    \item \textbf{Hospital Finder by Darshan University:}  
    This global application \textbf{only fetches hospital data from the Google Maps API} without allowing clinics to \textbf{add or modify their information}. Additionally, its \textbf{user interface is outdated}, making navigation difficult.  
    \item \textbf{Local Availability:}  
    Currently, \textbf{no local application} provides a \textbf{dedicated hospital and clinic management system} that allows clinics to \textbf{register themselves, update details, and display real-time doctor availability}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Critique of Existing Solutions and Proposed Solution}}  

\textbf{Limitations of Existing Solutions:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item No \textbf{custom clinic registration} or modifications  
    \item Outdated UI and poor \textbf{user experience}  
    \item No \textbf{detailed doctor profiles and schedules}  
    \item Google Maps data is \textbf{too general} and lacks \textbf{localized clinic information}  
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Proposed Solution:}  
To overcome these limitations, our \textbf{Hospital Finder Mobile Application} introduces:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Geolocation} → Provides \textbf{precise clinic locations} added by clinic administrators themselves.  
    \item \textbf{Clinic Registration \& Management} → Clinics can \textbf{create, modify, and update their information}.  
    \item \textbf{Detailed Doctor Profiles} → Displays \textbf{doctor specialties, working hours, availability, and schedules}.  
    \item \textbf{Nearby Hospital \& Clinic Recommendations} → Suggests hospitals and clinics \textbf{based on real-time location}.  
    \item \textbf{Modern UI \& Better User Experience} → A \textbf{new, intuitive, and visually appealing interface}.  
\end{itemize}

\section{\textbf{Conclusion}} 

The existing hospital location solutions fail to provide \textbf{detailed, precise, and user-friendly} hospital and clinic information. Our \textbf{Hospital Finder Mobile Application} bridges this gap by offering:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{better geolocation system} for \textbf{more accurate clinic placement}.  
    \item The ability for \textbf{clinics to register and update their details}.  
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive doctor profiles}, making hospital visits more efficient.  
    \item \textbf{A modern UI} with an intuitive design for easy navigation.  
\end{itemize}

\noindent This enhanced system will significantly improve \textbf{healthcare accessibility} and provide a \textbf{better user experience} compared to existing solutions.
